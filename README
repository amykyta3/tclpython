tclpython version 4.1: a Python package for Tcl

This package allows the execution of Python (version 2.2 or above)
code from a Tcl interpreter, as in:


    package require tclpython 4.1
    set interpreter [python::interp new]
    $interpreter exec {print("Hello World")}
    puts [$interpreter eval 3/2.0]
    python::interp delete $interpreter


You can actually create several Python interpreters this way, if the
tclpython package was linked against a Python library compiled with
threads support, otherwise only 1 Python interpreter can exist at a
time.

Starting with version 4.1, you can also access and use the parent Tcl
interpreter from a Python interpreter:

    package require tclpython 4.1
    set interpreter [python::interp new]
    puts [$interpreter eval {tcl.eval('clock format [clock seconds]')}]
    python::interp delete $interpreter

You should pay attention to space with the python interpreter. The
line in the sample will work but this one will not:

    puts [$interpreter eval { tcl.eval('clock format [clock seconds]') }]
