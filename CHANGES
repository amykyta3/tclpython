improved windows support by George Petasis, who created a page for
providing binaries for various ActiveState releases (many thanks!):
http://www.ellogon.org/petasis/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=27&Itemid=43
- various fixes in the C syntax that caused errors in VC++ compiler
- Makefile.vc included in distribution for compiling under Windows
- fixes in package index files to ensure that the extension gets loaded
--- version 4.0 ---------------------------------------------------------------
allowed evaluation of Tcl code in parent Tcl interpreter from Python
  interpreters (thanks to Daniel Savard)
added tclpython.h file for possible use in extensions to tclpython
allowed Tcl interpreter access from C code so tclpython can be extended
included Tcl stubs checking macros in tclpython.c
--- version 3.1 ---------------------------------------------------------------
added Tcl stubs support (thanks to Georgios Petasis)
removed non public Tcl namespace code in C source
generated and tested on a Red Hat 9 system with gcc 3.3
--- version 3.0 ---------------------------------------------------------------
added an exec command on top of the eval command so that a patched python
  interpreter is no longer required (WARNING: creates incompatibilities with
  existing code: see upgrading section in HTML documentation)
--- version 2.1 ---------------------------------------------------------------
tclpython2 renamed to tclpython and updated for Python 2.2.1 as found
  in a Redhat 8.0 distribution
tclpython (for Python 1.5) dropped
prevent automatic 'import site' on a new thread, since it makes the
  program hang
--- version 2.0.1 -------------------------------------------------------------
errors from Python were not always caught and properly reported to the Tcl
  interpreter
tclpython2 binary rpm was wrongly compiled against another installation on my
  computer, which caused string I/O module loading failure and a core dump
--- version 2.0 ---------------------------------------------------------------
allow multiple Python interpreters
no longer requires the Python print command to pass data to the Tcl interpreter
embedded Python interpreters can now send data to standard output or error
  (useful for debuging, using the print function, for example)
successfully tested against the Python thread library
added tclpython2 rpm for Redhat python2 compatibility
includes 1 line addition patch to the Python sources
--- version 1.1 ---------------------------------------------------------------
include interpreter name in error messages
--- version 1.0.1 -------------------------------------------------------------
eval wrongly returned the accumulated output of the python interpreter since it
  was started
