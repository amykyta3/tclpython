If you are on a Redhat or Fedora machine, just use the rpms from
http://jfontain.free.fr/, otherwise you will have to compile the
library yourself, as described below.

For Python 2.2 and above, the automatic 'import site' on a new thread
is suppressed, since it makes the program hang. Note that if needed,
you can always use 'import site' in your code, as described at the top
of the Lib/site.py file.

After compiling the Python code (actually, only the libpythonX.X.a is
required), generate the tclpython library using:

$ cc -shared -o tclpython.so.4.1 -fPIC -O2 -Wall -I/usr/include/python2.2 tclpython.c tclthread.c -L/usr/lib/python2.2/config -lpython2.2 -lpthread -lutil /usr/lib/libtclstub`echo 'puts $tcl_version' | tclsh`.a

(for other Python versions, Tcl stubs support and platform examples,
see the tclpython.c source file).

Then copy the shared library above and the included pkgIndex.tcl file,
to the following directory that you create:

1)    /usr/lib/tclpython/
  or:
2)    /usr/local/lib/tclpython/
  or:
3)    /opt/tcltk/lib/tclpython/

depending on your Tcl installation, as the following examples show:

1) $ echo 'puts $auto_path' | tclsh
   /usr/lib/tcl8.3 /usr/lib

2) $ echo 'puts $auto_path' | tclsh
   /usr/local/lib/tcl8.3 /usr/local/lib

3) $ echo 'puts $auto_path' | tclsh8.4
   /opt/tcltk/lib/tcl8.4 /opt/tcltk/lib

the idea being that the tclpython directory is a sub-directory of one of
the components of the auto path list.

And that is it. To actually check that it works:

$ tclsh
% package require tclpython
4.1
% [python::interp new] eval 3/2.0
1.5
% exit
